<p>In this episode we&rsquo;ll take a look at <a href="http://activeadmin.info">Active Admin</a>. This gem lets you easily add an admin interface to your Rails applications. It creates good-looking admin pages and is very customizable. You can see it in action by taking a look at the <a href="http://demo.activeadmin.info/admin">live demo</a>.</p>

<p>In this episode we&rsquo;ll add Active Admin to an existing Rails application. The app we&rsquo;ll be working with is a simple e-commerce app that has number of products, each of which has a price and belongs to a category. We&rsquo;ll use Active Admin to create an admin interface so that we can manage the products.</p>

<h3>Installing Active Admin</h3>

<p>Active Admin is distributed as a gem and installed in the usual way, by adding a reference to it in the <code>Gemfile</code> and then running <code>bundle</code>. Our application is a Rails 3.1 app so we&rsquo;ll need to make sure that we also include the <code>sass-rails</code> gem as Active Admin depends it. Under Rails 3.0 this isn&rsquo;t an issue and we don&rsquo;t need to include it.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/Gemfile</p>
<pre class="ruby">gem &#x27;activeadmin&#x27;</pre>

<p>Once Bundler has finished we need to run a generator to add Active Admin to our application. This generator will give us instructions on some additional setting-up we&rsquo;ll need to do after it has run. We need to add the <code>host</code> option to the Mailer configuration in the development environment; make sure we have a root URL and add <code>notice</code> and <code>alert</code> flash messages to the application&rsquo;s layout file.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails g active_admin:install
      invoke  devise
    generate    devise:install
      create    config/initializers/devise.rb
      create    config/locales/devise.en.yml

==================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven&#x27;t yet:

  1. Setup default url options for your specific environment. Here is an example of development environment:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host =&gt; &#x27;localhost:3000&#x27; }

     This is a required Rails configuration. In production it must be the actual host of your application

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to =&gt; &quot;home#index&quot;

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. For example:

       &lt;p class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;&lt;%= notice %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;&lt;%= alert %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already done all of this for our application so we&rsquo;re ready to continue.</p>

<p>The command also creates some migrations so we&rsquo;ll run them now.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rake db:migrate</pre>

<h3>Using Active Admin</h3>

<p>If we look at <a href="http://activeadmin.info/documentation.html">Active Admin&rsquo;s documentation</a> we&rsquo;ll see that when we install it it creates a user with the username <code>admin@example.com</code> and the password <code>password</code>. We can use these credentials to log in. (You can customize the username and password by editing the <code>devise_create_admin_users.rb</code> migration file before running the migrations.)  If we visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/admin">http://localhost:3000/admin</a> with the Rails server running we&rsquo;ll see a login form where we can log in with the credentials shown above.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/736/original/E284I02.png" width="799" height="458" alt="Active Admin's login page."/>
</div>

<p>After we&rsquo;ve logged in we&rsquo;ll be taken to Active Admin&rsquo;s dashboard although there won&rsquo;t be much to see yet.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/737/original/E284I03.png" width="799" height="458" alt="Active Admin's dashboard."/>
</div>

<p>We want to manage our products so we&rsquo;ll add our <code>Product</code> resource to Active Admin by running this command:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails g active_admin:resource product
      create  app/admin/products.rb</pre>

<p>This generator creates a <code>products.rb</code> file under the application&rsquo;s <code>app/admin</code> directory. When we refresh the admin dashboard we&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;Products&rdquo; link; if we click this link we&rsquo;ll be taken to a page that has everything we need to manage our products.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/738/original/E284I04.png" width="802" height="474" alt="The products index admin page."/>
</div>

<p>This page has options to sort or filter the products by any attribute. Active Admin will even detect the <code>belongs_to</code> relationship with <code>Category</code> and give us a dropdown menu so that we can filter products by their category. This works when we create a new product, too. The category is shown as a dropdown list and the other attributes will have input fields based on their datatype.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/739/original/E284I05.png" width="802" height="474" alt="The new product page."/>
</div>

<p>Customizing this functionality is easy. We&rsquo;ll start by customizing the products index page and reducing the number of columns that are shown. To do this we modify the <code>/app/admin/products.rb</code> file that was generated earlier. We change the index page by overriding the <code>index</code> method. This method takes a block, inside which we specify the columns we want to see on the page by calling <code>column</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column :released_at
    column :price
  end
end</pre>

<p>When we reload the products page now we&rsquo;ll see it shows the columns we want.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/740/original/E284I06.png" width="802" height="474" alt="The products page now shows our customized choice of columns."/>
</div>

<p>Note that the <code>Category</code> association has been detected automatically and the correct category is shown against each product.</p>

<p>We can take this customization further and change the title of a column by passing a title in as the first argument to <code>column</code>. We&rsquo;ll use this to change the name of the <code>released_at</code> field.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column &quot;Release Date&quot;, :released_at
    column :price
  end
end</pre>

<p>If we want to change a column&rsquo;s values we can do so by passing a block to <code>column</code>. The price field doesn&rsquo;t currently show a currency symbol but we can modify it to do so. The <code>column</code> method can take a block and when we add one the current model instance, in this case a <code>Product</code>, is passed into that block. Whatever the block returns will be shown in that column. We have access to helper methods here and so we can use <code>number_to_currency</code> to display the price correctly.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column &quot;Release Date&quot;, :released_at
    column :price do |product|
      number_to_currency product.price, :unit =&gt; &quot;&amp;pound;&quot;
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>If we reload the page now we&rsquo;ll see the changed &ldquo;Release Date&rdquo; title and each product&rsquo;s price displayed as a currency value.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/741/original/E284I07.png" width="802" height="474" alt="The price column now shows currency values."/>
</div>

<p>Customizing the value returned by the price field means that the field is no longer sortable. Also we no longer have edit and destroy links for each item. We&rsquo;ll fix that now. Whenever we use a block to customize a value we should also use the <code>:sortable</code> option to tell Active Admin how to sort that field. We&rsquo;ll do that now and also add a call to <code>default_actions</code> to bring back the edit and destroy links.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column &quot;Release Date&quot;, :released_at
    column :price, :sortable =&gt; :price do |product|
      number_to_currency product.price, :unit =&gt; &quot;&amp;pound;&quot;
    end
    default_actions
  end
end</pre>

<p>The price field is now showing the currency symbol but it would be better if the values were right-aligned too. We can do this with CSS but to do so we&rsquo;ll need a way to reference the column first. Active Admin provides a way to generate HTML that is very similar to <a href="http://markaby.github.com/">Markaby</a>. All we need to do is call a method with the name of the tag that we want to generate. We can pass in a <code>:class</code> option here to give the tag something we can reference in our CSS.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column &quot;Release Date&quot;, :released_at
    column :price, :sortable =&gt; :price do |product|
      div :class =&gt; &quot;price&quot; do
        number_to_currency product.price, :unit =&gt; &quot;&amp;pound;&quot;
      end
    end
    default_actions
  end
end</pre>

<p>We can now style this column by modifying the <code>active_admin.css.scss</code> file.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.css.scss</p>
<pre class="css">// Active Admin CSS Styles
@import &quot;active_admin/mixins&quot;;
@import &quot;active_admin/base&quot;;

// To customize the Active Admin interfaces, add your
// styles here:
.price {
  text-align :right;
}</pre>

<p>The price column will now be aligned correctly.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/742/original/E284I08.png" width="802" height="472" alt="The price column is now right-aligned."/>
</div>

<h3>Scopes</h3>

<p>Scopes are another great feature of Active Admin. These act like a pre-set filter and there are two steps to creating one. First we add a call to <code>scope</code> in Active Admin&rsquo;s configuration file for our products, passing in the name of a scope.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/products.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  scope :unreleased
  index do
    column :name
    column :category
    column &quot;Release Date&quot;, :released_at
    column :price, :sortable =&gt; :price do |product|
      div :class =&gt; &quot;price&quot; do
        number_to_currency product.price, :unit =&gt; &quot;&amp;pound;&quot;
      end
    end
    default_actions
  end
end</pre>

<p>Secondly we have to write that scope in the <code>Product</code> model.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/models/product.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  scope :unreleased, where(:released_at =&gt; nil)
end</pre>

<p>If we reload the products admin page now we&rsquo;ll see the scope listed. When we click it we&rsquo;ll be shown a list of products filtered by that scope.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/743/original/E284I09.png" width="802" height="472" alt="The products filtered by the unreleased scope."/>
</div>

<h3>Customizing The Dashboard</h3>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll take a look at customizing the dashboard. It&rsquo;s empty by default so we&rsquo;ll modify it to show a list of the most recent products. We do this by modifying the <code>/app/admin/dashboards.rb</code> file. There&rsquo;s some useful documentation in this file&rsquo;s comment explaining how the various customizations work.</p>

<p>To add a section to the dashboard we use the <code>section</code> method. We want to list the recent products in a table and we can do so by using the <code>table_for</code> command. Inside its block we specify the columns we want to show with <code>column</code> the same way we did when we customized the products index admin page. We&rsquo;ll also add a link back to the page that shows all of the products.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/dashboards.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin::Dashboards.build do
  section &quot;Recent Products&quot; do
    table_for Product.order(&quot;released_at desc&quot;).limit(5) do
      column :name
      column :released_at
    end
    strong { link_to &quot;View All Products&quot;, admin_products_path }
  end
end</pre>

<p>When we reload the dashboard now we&rsquo;ll see the five most recently released products along with that link.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/744/original/E284I10.png" width="802" height="472" alt="The most recent products shown in the dashboard."/>
</div>

<p>The page would be more useful if each product in the list linked to that product&rsquo;s admin page. We can do that by passing a block to the <code>column</code> method again, just like we did with the price column earlier.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/admin/dashboards.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin::Dashboards.build do
  section &quot;Recent Products&quot; do
    table_for Product.order(&quot;released_at desc&quot;).limit(5) do
      column :name do |product|
        link_to product.title, admin_product_path(product)
      end
      column :released_at
    end
    strong { link_to &quot;View All Products&quot;, admin_products_path }
  end
end</pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s a shorter way to define the path in <code>link_to</code>. Instead of using <code>admin_product_path(product)</code> we can pass in an array with a symbol as the first element and the product as the second, like this:</p>

<pre class="ruby">link_to product.title, [:admin, product]</pre>

<p>If we reload our dashboard now we&rsquo;ll see each product&rsquo;s title shown as a link. When we click one of the links we&rsquo;re taken to the admin page for that product.</p>

<h3>Fixing The Stylesheets</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a problem we need to be aware of when using Active Admin under Rails 3.1 and we can see it by going back to the main site.</p>

 <div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/745/original/E284I11.png" width="801" height="435" alt="The home page now has incorrect styling."/>
</div>

<p>The page doesn&rsquo;t look like it did before because Active Admin&rsquo;s stylesheet is being included on every page. Rails 3.1 includes all stylesheets by default due to the line <code>require_tree .</code> in the <code>application.css</code> manifest file. This isn&rsquo;t what we want and anyway it&rsquo;s good idea to remove this line to give us more control over our application&rsquo;s stylesheets. We only have one other stylesheet in the main application so we&rsquo;ll replace <code>require_tree .</code> with <code>require products</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</p>
<pre class="css">/*
 * This is a manifest file that&#x27;ll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You&#x27;re free to add application-wide styles to this file and they&#x27;ll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it&#x27;s generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *= require_self
 *= require products
*/

/* Rest of file omitted */</pre>

<p>An even better solution is to switch over to the SASS <code>import</code> command. We can switch our application&rsquo;s main CSS file over to SASS by adding a <code>.scss</code> extension to its name. We can then remove the manifest from the top of the file (the part of the file you can see in the code snippet above) and add the import command at the bottom.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss</p>
<pre class="css">/* Styles omitted */

@import &quot;products&quot;;</pre>

<p>When we reload the homepage now only the correct stylesheets are included and the page looks correct.</p>

<h3>Global Configuration</h3>

<p>Active Admin has another configuration file in the <code>/config/initializers</code> directory and we&rsquo;ll spend the rest of this episode taking a look at it. The file contains a large number of configuration options, most of which are commented out. One that isn&rsquo;t is the admin site&rsquo;s title and we&rsquo;ll change that.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/initializers/active_admin.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">ActiveAdmin.setup do |config|

  # == Site Title
  #
  # Set the title that is displayed on the main layout
  # for each of the active admin pages.
  #
  config.site_title = &quot;Eifion&#x27;s Store&quot;

  # Other configuration options omitted.
end</pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll need to restart the server for the change to be picked up, but when we do the new title will be shown.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/746/original/E284I12.png" width="801" height="435" alt="The new title is now shown."/>
</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this episode. There&rsquo;s plenty more to Active Admin that we haven&rsquo;t covered here and it&rsquo;s well worth taking a look at the documentation to see what else it can do. We can customize the look and functionality of all of Active Admin&rsquo;s pages  to suit our needs and this makes it a powerful solution to adding administrative functionality to your Rails applications.</p>
