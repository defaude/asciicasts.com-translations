<p>In this episode we&rsquo;ll talk about <code>with_scope</code>. Below is a <code>Task</code> model that has a class method that returns all of the incomplete tasks.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :project

  def self.find_incomplete
    find_all_by_complete(false, :order =&gt; 'created_at DESC')
  end
end
</pre>
<p>This method is used in the <code>TasksController</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = Task.find_incomplete
  end
</pre>
<p>This is a little limiting as we can&rsquo;t add conditions to the custom <code>find</code> method to find, say, the first twenty incomplete tasks. What we want to do is something like</p>
<pre class="ruby">@tasks = Task.find_incomplete :limit =&gt; 20</pre>
<p>One way to do this is to add an options hash to the <code>find_incomplete</code> method in the model and merge it with the options in the find, but a more elegant solution exists with <code>find_scope</code>, passing the <code>find</code> options.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :project

  def self.find_incomplete(options = {})
    with_scope :find =&gt; options do
      find_all_by_complete(false, :order =&gt; 'created_at DESC')
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Any <code>find</code> executed within the <code>with_scope</code> block will automatically inherit the specified options. Now the <code>find_incomplete</code> can take any conditions passed. This will also work within another scope. Our custom method is called in the <code>ProjectsController</code>. We can pass a limit condition here as well. This <code>find</code> passes through two scopes: first the incomplete tasks are found within the scope of the specified project and secondly they are limited to the first twenty.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
@tasks = @project.tasks.find_incomplete :limit =&gt; 20
</pre>
