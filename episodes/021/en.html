<p>In the previous episode we showed you how to show or hide administration links depending on whether the current user is an admin. We did this by writing a boolean method called <code>admin?</code> in our <code>ApplicationController</code>. If <code>admin?</code> returned <code>true</code> then the links were shown, otherwise they were hidden. We left the method just returning <code>false</code>; what we need to do is finish writing that method and provide a way for admin users to log on to the site.</p>

<h3>There&rsquo;s More Than One Way To Do It</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to implement the login system. We could implement an entire user registration system with a <code>User</code> model, a registration page and so on. If we were to take this approach there is an excellent plugin called <code>restful_authentication</code>, which is an updated version of <code>acts_as_authenticated</code>, available for download.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Once installed, the User model and a controller called Sessions can be generated like this.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$script/plugin install git://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication.git restful_authentication
$script/generate authenticated User sessions
$rake db:migrate
</pre>
<p>We won&rsquo;t be using Restful Authentication here. The <code>restful_authentication</code> plugin will be discussed in more detail in episode 67.</p>

<p>Our website is so simple that a whole user administration system is not needed. We only need to administer the episodes on the site, so we&rsquo;ll go for a more straightforward approach that doesn&rsquo;t need a User model or any plugins. If we wanted to take a really basic approach we could restrict access by IP address and write our <code>admin?</code> method like this.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def admin
  request.remote_ip == &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
end
</pre>
<p>This is rather limiting as it assumes that your Internet connection has a static IP address and that you&rsquo;re always going to want to administer your website from the same location. Instead of that we&rsquo;ll build a simple login page that just takes a password. If the password is entered correctly then the user will see the admin links.</p>

<p class="title">Our basic login page.</p>
<p>To do this we&rsquo;ll generate a Sessions controller. The controller&rsquo;s code is below.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end

  def create
    session[:password] = params[:password]
    flash[:notice] = &rsquo;Successfully logged in&rsquo;
    redirect_to home_path
  end
  
  def destroy
    reset_session
    flash[:notice] = &rsquo;Successfully logged out&rsquo;
    redirect_to login_path
  end
end
</pre>
<p>There is also a basic new view in the <code>/views/sessions</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
&lt;% form_tag sessions_path do %&gt;
  Password: &lt;%= password_field_tag :password %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag &quot;Login&quot; %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>The form is submitted to the <code>create</code> action which stores the entered password in the session then redirects to the home page. In our <code>admin?</code> method we check the password in the session against the correct password and return true if they match.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def admin?
  session[:password] == &quot;secret&quot;
end
</pre>

<h3>Done!</h3>
<p>Our basic login page is now complete. While not as sophisticated as a full user management system like that provided by Restful Authentication, it is good enough to serve for our simple site.</p>
<p>Finally, in case you are wondering how we gave the login page the url /login, it&rsquo;s done by adding these two routes to <code>routes.rb</code></p>
<pre class="ruby">
  map.connect &rsquo;login&rsquo;, :controller =&gt; &rsquo;sessions&rsquo;, :action =&gt; &rsquo;create&rsquo;
  map.connect &rsquo;logout&rsquo;, :controller =&gt; &rsquo;sessions&rsquo;, :action =&gt; &rsquo;destroy&rsquo;
</pre>
