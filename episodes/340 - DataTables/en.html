<p><a href="http://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> makes it easy to turn a plain HTML table into one with pagination, sorting and searching and all through JavaScript. In this episode we&rsquo;ll show you how to set it up and how to supply data from a Rails application. The page below displays a plain table of Product records. We&rsquo;ll add DataTables to it to improve it.</p>

<h3>Adding DataTables to Our Application</h3>

<p>We could just download the <a href="http://datatables.net/">source code</a> and use it in our Rails application but this is a little difficult to add to the asset pipeline as the code includes references to images with relative paths that we&rsquo;d have to fix. Fortunately there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/rweng/jquery-datatables-rails"><code>jquery-datatables-rails</code> gem </a>available that makes this much easier. We&rsquo;ll add this to the <code>assets</code> group in  our gemfile. As this gem is updated fairly frequently and we want to use the latest version we&rsquo;ll use the <code>github</code> option and pass in the project&rsquo;s path.</p>

``` /Gemfile
group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'

  # See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
  # gem 'therubyracer', :platform => :ruby

  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
  gem 'jquery-datatables-rails', github: 'rweng/jquery-datatables-rails'
end
```

<p>The <code>github</code> option is new in Bundler 1.1. If you don&rsquo;t have this you&rsquo;ll need to pass in the full git path instead. As always when adding a gem we&rsquo;ll need to run <code>bundle</code> to install it. We can now set DataTables up with the asset pipeline. First we&rsquo;ll go to the <code>application.js</code> file and add a call to <code>dataTables/jquery.dataTables</code> in the manifest.</p>

``` /app/assets/javascripts/application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require dataTables/jquery.dataTables
//= require_tree .
```

<p>There&rsquo;s also come CSS we need to include so we&rsquo;ll need to do add something in <code>application.css</code>, too.</p>

``` /app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *= require_self
 *= require dataTables/jquery.dataTables
 *= require_tree . 
*/
```

<h3>Adding DataTables to Our Table</h3>

<p>Now that we have DataTables installed in our application we can use it to improve our table of products. The view code for that table is shown below and it&rsquo;s fairly straightforward; all we do is loop through each product and render it in the table.</p>

``` /app/views/products/index.html.erb
<h1>Products</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Product Name</th>
    <th>Category</th>
    <th>Release Date</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
<% @products.each do |product| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(product.name, product) %></td>
    <td><%= product.category %></td>
    <td><%= product.released_on.strftime("%B %e, %Y") %></td>
    <td><%= number_to_currency(product.price) %></td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
</table>
```

<p>To prepare this table for use with DataTables we need to wrap the header row inside a <code>thead</code> element and the body section in <code>tbody</code>. We also need a way to reference the the table from JavaScript so we&rsquo;ll give it an <code>id</code>.</p>

``` /app/views/products/index.html.erb
<h1>Products</h1>

<table id="products">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product Name</th>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Release Date</th>
      <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <tr>
      <td><%= link_to(product.name, product) %></td>
      <td><%= product.category %></td>
      <td><%= product.released_on.strftime("%B %e, %Y") %></td>
      <td><%= number_to_currency(product.price) %></td>
    </tr>
  <% end %>
  <tbody>
</table>
```

<p>We can add DataTables to this table now with some CoffeeScript code. We&rsquo;ll do this in the <code>products.js</code> file. All we need to do is ensure that the DOM has loaded then call <code>dataTable</code> on our table.</p>

``` /app/assets/javascripts/products.js
jQuery ->
	$('#products').dataTable()
```	

<p>When we reload the page now our table looks quite different. We now have a DataTable with pagination, sorting and searching.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/1116/original/E340I02.png" width="800" height="531" alt="Our table is now a DataTable."/>
</div>

<h3>Customizing Our DataTable</h3>

<p>There are many different options that we can pass to dataTable to change our table&rsquo;s appearance and behaviour.  For example setting <code>sPaginationType</code> will change the pagination; if we set this to <code>full_numbers</code> this will show a link for each page. The <a href="http://datatables.net/usage/options">usage section</a> of the DataTables site has a full list of the options we can use to customize our DataTable.</p>

``` /app/assets/javascripts/products.js.coffee
jQuery ->
	$('#products').dataTable
	  sPaginationType: "full_numbers"
```	  
	  
<p>Reloading the page now will show the new pagination style.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/1117/original/E340I03.png" width="800" height="531" alt="The pagination now has links to each page."/>
</div>

<h3>Improving The Styling</h3>

<p>The styling for our table isn&rsquo;t perfect but we can change this. The DataTables homepage has an example table that&rsquo;s nicely styled and we can use this with our table. The example table uses jQuery UI and this is included in the <code>jquery-rails</code> gem that&rsquo;s in our gemfile. The CSS styling that we need for our table isn&rsquo;t included, however, but there&rsquo;s another gem, called <code>jquery-ui-rails</code>, that does. To add this we just include it in the gemfile and then run <code>bundle</code> again.</p>

``` /Gemfile
group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'

  # See https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
  # gem 'therubyracer', :platform => :ruby

  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
  gem 'jquery-datatables-rails', github: 'rweng/jquery-datatables-rails'
  gem 'jquery-ui-rails'
end
```

<p>To add the CSS to our application we need to add <code>jquery.ui.core</code> and <code>jquery.ui.theme</code> to our application.css file. This will include the Smoothness theme. We also need to replace the DataTables CSS file with one that is designed for jQuery UI and one called <code>demo_table_jui</code> is provided under the <code>src</code> directory. We&rsquo;ll replace the <code>jQuery.dataTables</code> CSS with this.</p>

``` /app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *= require_self
 *= require jquery.ui.core
 *= require jquery.ui.theme
 *= require dataTables/src/demo_table_jui
 *= require_tree . 
*/
```

<p>We now need to add a <code>bJQueryUI</code> option to our call to <code>dataTable</code>.</p>

``` /app/assets/javascripts/products.js.coffee
jQuery ->
	$('#products').dataTable
	  sPaginationType: "full_numbers"
	  bJQueryUI: true
```	  

<p>Finally we&rsquo;ll need to give our table a <code>class</code> of <code>display</code>.</p>

``` /app/views/products/index.html.erb
<table id="products" class="display">
```

<p>Reloading the page now shows a much better looking table.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="http://asciicasts.com/system/photos/1118/original/E340I04.png" width="800" height="549" alt="The table now looks much better."/>
</div>

<h3>Updating The Table With Data From The Server</h3>

<p>Our table has pagination, sorting and searching but this currently all happens on the client. Our HTML page includes all the products from the database and DataTable handles choosing the ones to be displayed based on the page, sort order or search term chosen. This works well for small numbers of records, say up to 200, but if we have thousands or even millions of records we don&rsquo;t want to send all this data to the client to be handled there. In these cases its better to send only the necessary records to the client and have DataTable communicate with the server when the selected page, sort field or search term changes. The Server-side <a href="http://datatables.net/usage/server-side">processing page</a> of the documentation tells us the parameters that are sent to the server and what to expect in response through JSON. We need to set up our Rails application to be able to deal with this and we&rsquo;ll need a way to do pagination on the server so we&rsquo;ll add <code>will_paginate</code> to our gemfile and run bundle again to install it.</p>

``` /Gemfile
gem 'will_paginate'
```

<p>We no longer want to display all the products in our template as these will now be fetched from the server. We&rsquo;ll need to define the URL that the relevant set of products can be fetched from and we&rsquo;ll put this in a data attribute on the opening <code>table</code> tag. We&rsquo;ll use the <code>products_url</code> and tell it to use the JSON format.</p>

``` /app/views/products/index.html.erb
<h1>Products</h1>

<table id="products" class="display" data-source="<%= products_url(format: "json") %>">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product Name</th>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Release Date</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tbody>
</table>
```

<p>In our Coffeescript file we&rsquo;ll need to add some more options to the call to dataTable to tell it to fetch data from the server.</p>

``` /app/assets/javascripts/products.js.coffee
jQuery ->
	$('#products').dataTable
	  sPaginationType: "full_numbers"
	  bJQueryUI: true
	  bProcessing: true
	  bServerSide: true
	  sAjaxSource: $('#products').data('source')
```	  

<p>The <code>bProcessing</code> option shows a &ldquo;Processing&rdquo; message while fetching data from the server. Setting <code>bServerSide</code> to true means that the data will be fetched from the server. Finally <code>sAjaxSource</code> sets the URL that the data will be fetched from and we set this to the value in the <code>data-source</code> attribute that we defined in our table. DataTable will now trigger the <code>ProductsController</code>&rsquo;s <code>index</code> action and it will expect a JSON response. We&rsquo;ll use a <code>respond_to</code> block to do this. The tricky part will be responding with the proper JSON. One option would be to use something like JBuilder or RABL, but these solutions can get messy very quickly as there&rsquo;s quite a lot of logic required to generate the correct response.</p>

<p>If the MVC structure of Rails ever feels limiting and doesn&rsquo;t fit with what we&rsquo;re trying to do there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with creating a new class if it leads to cleaner code. This is the approach we&rsquo;ll take here. We&rsquo;ll create a new <code>ProductsDatatable</code> class to generate the JSON and we&rsquo;ll have it take a view context in its constructor so that it has access to helper methods. This makes it like a mini-presenter for a JSON response. We&rsquo;ll create this class in a new <code>datatables</code> directory under the app directory. There&rsquo;s too much code in this class to show here, but you can find the whole thing on <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/railscasts-episodes/blob/master/episode-340/store-after/app/datatables/products_datatable.rb">Github</a>. We&rsquo;ll run through it quickly and show the most interesting parts.</p>

<p>The <code>initializer</code> takes a view context and assigns it to an instance variable. We delegate a few helper methods to this view so that we can conveniently call them from here.</p> 

``` /app/datatables/products_datatable.rb
delegate :params, :h, :link_to, :number_to_currency, to: :@view

def initialize(view)
  @view = view
end
```

<p>The <code>as_json</code> method is triggered behind the scenes by the <code>render_json</code> call in the controller. This will return all the data that DataTables expects including all the relevant rows from the database. This data comes from a <code>data</code> method and this method loops through each of the products and returns a two-dimensional array containing the information for each cell in the table.</p>

``` /app/datatables/products_datatable.rb
def as_json(options = {})
  {
    sEcho: params[:sEcho].to_i,
    iTotalRecords: Product.count,
    iTotalDisplayRecords: products.total_entries,
    aaData: data
  }
end

private
def data
  products.map do |product|
    [
      link_to(product.name, product),
      h(product.category),
      h(product.released_on.strftime("%B %e, %Y")),
      number_to_currency(product.price)
    ]
  end
end
```

<p>The products are fetched in a <code>fetch_products</code> method. This fetches the correct page of data in the correct order filtered by a search term if one is present. The search query itself is simple but we could expand on it, maybe by using a full-text search engine such as Sphinx or Solr.</p> 

``` /app/datatables/products_datatable.rb
def fetch_products
  products = Product.order("#{sort_column} #{sort_direction}")
  products = products.page(page).per_page(per_page)
  if params[:sSearch].present?
    products = products.where("name like :search or category like :search", search: "%#{params[:sSearch]}%")
  end
  products
end
```

<p>The rest of the class is made up of methods to help with sorting and pagination. Now that we have this class we can use it in our controller action.</p>

``` /app/controllers/products_controller.rb
def index
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html
    format.json { render json: ProductsDatatable.new(view_context) }
  end
end
```

<p>When we reload the page now (we may need to restart the server first) everything works much as it did before. We still have the same pagination, sorting and searching behaviour but now the data is being supplied by the Rails application instead of being loaded all in one go on the client. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for our episode on DataTables. It does require some effort if you need server-side processing but the end result is well worth it. If you&rsquo;re interested in an alternative solution where we create something similar from scratch take a look at <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/240-search-sort-paginate-with-ajax">episode 240</a>.</p>
